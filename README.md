# DecodeTheLook - Web CTF 🕵️‍♂️💻

Welcome to the **DecodeTheLook** Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge! 🎉

This is a simple web-based CTF designed to test your ability to inspect a webpage 🔍 and decode an encoded flag 🏴. The challenge involves finding hidden information in the source code and decoding it using **Base64** encoding. Are you ready to test your skills? Let’s dive in! 🚀

## Challenge Overview 🏁

In this challenge, the flag is hidden within the website's source code. You will need to **inspect the page** and follow the clues to find the hidden flag, which is split into **two parts** and encoded using **Base64**. The goal is to decode both parts and combine them to obtain the final flag. 🔑

## FLAG FORMAT ⚠️

The flag you find will be in the following format:

`flag{***_***_*****_***_*******_****}`

Ensure that you combine the decoded parts correctly and match this format to complete the challenge. 🔐

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with this CTF challenge, you can run the website locally.

### Prerequisites 📝

- A web browser for inspecting the page (Right-click → Inspect or `Ctrl+Shift+I`). 🌐
- A Base64 decoder (you can use an online tool like [Base64 Decode](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)). 🧑‍💻

### Steps to Solve 🏆

1. Inspect the webpage's source code. 🔍
2. Look for any clues or hidden content. 🧐
3. Decode the Base64 parts. 🧩
4. Combine the decoded parts to reveal the flag! 🚩

Good luck and happy hunting! 🥳💻
