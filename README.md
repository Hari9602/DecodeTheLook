# DecodeTheLook - Web CTF

Welcome to the **DecodeTheLook** Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge!

This is a simple web-based CTF designed to test your ability to inspect a webpage and decode an encoded flag. The challenge involves finding hidden information in the source code and decoding it using **Base64** encoding.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the flag is hidden within the website's source code. You will need to inspect the page and follow the clues to find the hidden flag, which is split into **two parts** and encoded using **Base64**. The goal is to decode the parts and combine them to obtain the final flag.


## FLAG FORMAT

The flag you find will be in the following format:

`flag{***_***_*****_***_*******_****}`


Ensure that you combine the decoded parts correctly and match this format to complete the challenge.

## Getting Started

To get started with this CTF challenge, you can run the website locally.

### Prerequisites

- A web browser for inspecting the page (Right-click → Inspect or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
- A Base64 decoder (you can use an online tool like [Base64 Decode](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)).

### Steps to Solve

1. Inspect the webpage's source code.
2. Look for any clues or hidden content.
3. Decode the Base64 parts.
4. Combine the decoded parts to reveal the flag!

Good luck and happy hunting! 💻
